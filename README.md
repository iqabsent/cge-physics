Rushed attempt to write a 2D physics engine in JS

##Does do##
Polygon (convex, possibly concave) collision detection
- Broad-phase using max radius from center

- Calculates Mass (Area) and Centroid (though this is not used yet)

- Collision response (only just) based on inverse mass

- Lovely visual indicators ^_^

- Can click * drag (locking physics for dragged poly)
